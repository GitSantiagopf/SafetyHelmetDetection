# Safety Helmet Detection

## **Overview**

The Safety Helmet Detection project is a computer vision application designed to enhance workplace safety by detecting the improper use of safety helmets in industrial or construction settings. It utilizes the YOLOv8m (You Only Look Once version 8 medium) deep learning model for object detection and is built to prevent workplace accidents caused by employees not wearing safety helmets.

This project is powered by a meticulously labeled dataset obtained from Roboflow, ensuring accurate detection of safety helmets and potential violations in real-world scenarios.

## **Introduction**

In industrial and construction environments, wearing safety helmets is crucial to protect workers from head injuries. Failure to comply with safety regulations regarding helmet use can lead to serious accidents. The Safety Helmet Detection project aims to mitigate such risks by automating the detection of helmet violations. This README provides essential information on how to set up, train, and use the system effectively.

## **Prerequisites**
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

-Python 3.6 or higher

-GPU with CUDA support (recommended for faster training)

-NVIDIA GPU drivers and CUDA Toolkit (if using GPU)

-Roboflow account to access the labeled dataset
