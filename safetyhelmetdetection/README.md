Safety Helmet Detection
==============================

The Safety Helmet Detection project is a computer vision application designed to enhance workplace safety by detecting the improper use of safety helmets in industrial or construction settings. It utilizes the YOLOv8m (You Only Look Once version 8 medium) deep learning model for object detection and is built to prevent workplace accidents caused by employees not wearing safety helmets.

This project is powered by a meticulously labeled dataset obtained from Roboflow, ensuring accurate detection of safety helmets and potential violations in real-world scenarios.
